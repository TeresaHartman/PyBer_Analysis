# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
#### The purpose of the new analysis:
Pyber, a python based ride sharing app company, has charged us with performing an expoloritory analysis on data that they have provided. To aid this process, a variety of charts have been created to visualize the data. This will showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, including the percentage of total fares. The analysis and visualizations will help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability to neigherborhoods that aren't 

### Results
#### There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types:

As we see in the chart above, there are significant differences in all categories in ride-sharing data among the three different city types: rural, suburban, and urban. First let's discuss the number of total rides and total drivers. We see that both of those numbers increase from rural to suburban to urban. This is expected as the total number of people that live in these areas also increase, repsectively. However, we notice that the average fare per ride and average far per drive decrease, repsectively. This is also expected, as in rural areas the trips would assumed to be longer trips in rural areas which would increase the average fare per ride and driver. Likewise, the trips in the urban areas would tend to be much shorter trips and therefore, decrease the average fares. The suburban would be in the middle with length of trips.

The time chart above here displays the total fare by city type from Janurary 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019. This chart really emphaises that urban communities will bring in vastly more dollars that suburban and rural. By the chart we see that urban communities earn approximately double of that from suburban communities, and four times as many from rural communities. 

### Summary
#### There is a statement summarizing business recommendations to the CEO: 
In consulting with PyBer, I would first recommend that they start with putting their app based company in urban areas over suburban and rural areas. While there is a smaller average fare for driver and ride, this is definitely ofset by the total number of rides and drivers. The total number of rides, drives, and total fares of urban areas is substantically higher than both the suburban and rural areas. If Pyber wants to put their company in more than one type of area, then I would put the majority focus on ruban, then less focus on suburban, and even less of a focus on rural areas. 

Another thing that is noticeble on the line chart, is that all three types of cities had a spike at the end of February and dip at the beginning of March. I suggest that they do more analysis on why that happened and if they could use that information to collect on peak times and prevent slower earning times.
